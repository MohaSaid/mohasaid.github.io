This is the **first post** of my blog. Here begins a new adventure for me.

In this blog I will try to focus on computer science concepts or interests 
that I have or I discover (you can find more in [about section](/about)) and experiences that I have as well.

Throughout the publications I will explain why I do this and where I intend to go with this. So let's be ready for the adventure!
