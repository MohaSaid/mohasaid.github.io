## Why this blog

Some years ago, when I started to get involved to the software world, learning new algorithms and new programming languages was my main goal. 
I was some kind of curious child who was dreaming about working in one of the biggest companies in the world, 
programming with the coolest and newest languages in that every moment. 

By that time, I used to happily code C++ and Java primarily, although along my way I have been learning different programming languages.

Today, my perception of the world and software has changed. Although my main goal remains, other things have changed in many ways: 
from closed to open, from insecure to more secure, from vulnerable to less vulnerable. And the things that back in those days 
did not matter to me like open source development, privacy, security, clean code and well structured code, today are 
some of my greatest motivations.

## What I expect

My vision today has changed in a way I did not expect and what I want to achieve is to give information to other people which 
I would have found very useful some time ago. What I pretend is to talk and to debate about two main topics:

- **Software technologies and best practices**
- **Social development and free software**

On the one hand, the first topic has two objectives: 

1. To provide me an archive of notes and tutorials to go back to them when I forget. 
2. To give to other people interested on those topics a series of best practices, design patterns, SOLID principles, opinions and tutorials 
I would have found very useful when I started tackling them.

On the other hand, the second point has the objective of giving opinion to any person no matter the knowledge about computer science 
he or she has about topics like free software, internet privacy, security and whatever it can come to my mind. 
In this particular case, I will do my best to write the articles in a way in which a person who uses the computer only as a user, 
can understand the concepts. I will try to support the opinions with objective data but they will be opinion articles in most of the cases.

With this blog I will also try to improve my english writing skills, so if you find any mistake, do not hesitate to contact me.

Having said that, I hope you enjoy it and happy coding!
