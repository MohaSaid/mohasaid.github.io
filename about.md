## Who am I

Hi! My name is Mohamed Said Benmousa. I was born in 1994 and I grew up in a little town of Barcelona where I am currently living.

I'm a **software engineer** build at [FIB-UPC Barcelona](https://www.fib.upc.edu/). I graduated on Computer Science at UPC and specialized at Software Engineering.
Since I graduated I’ve been discovering my passion for coding and computer science and now, I try to describe myself as a software engineer
but I consider myself a **problem solver**, as I like all kind of software development challenges.

This web page summarizes my career and tries to share and to remember me interesting topics about software through the blog.

## Interests

Since I was a child I’ve loved technology and computers. I liked a lot computer games and they influenced me to study computer science
as I always wondered how those games were made. Then I went to the university and I discovered my passion for programming.

And since then I keep learning new technologies every day in order to create new software to help me and others for the every-day life. To achieve that, 
in my free time I try to learn something or contribute to open source.

I also like to travel in order to learn new cultures and traditions; go to the beach, spend time with
my friends, go to the cinema, read and attend hackathons or meetups!

If I had to summarize my interests in computer science I think the keywords that I would say would be:

- SOLID principles
- Design patterns
- Algorithms
- Data structures
- Architectures
- Scalability
- Object oriented programming (OOP) 
- Agile methodologies
- Version control (Git)
- Continuous integration environments
- Computer security (Cryptography)
- Open Source

In this blog I will try to write about those topics apart from any experience that arises.
